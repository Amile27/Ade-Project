                <p>Let us begin with the fundamentals. For me, learning HTML and CSS was like opening a whole new universe. I was able to learn a great deal about the foundations of web development by building this website. Every stage of the process, from organising the pages with the appropriate HTML tags to applying CSS styling, was educational.

                    Let's now discuss the design. Selecting the ideal layout, colours, and fonts wasn't simple. The website needed to be both user-friendly and clean and current. To get a unified appearance and feel, I looked to a variety of websites and design resources for inspiration.
                    
                    Making the website responsive was one of the difficulties I encountered. It was important to make sure it looked fantastic on desktop and mobile devices. putting media queries and flexbox into practice</p>
